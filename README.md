# 💧 **Water Potability Analysis** 💧

## **Project Overview**

This project involves analyzing a water quality dataset to determine the potability of water based on various chemical and physical attributes. The dataset includes water quality indicators such as pH, hardness, conductivity, and organic carbon, among others.

---

## **Dataset Description**

The dataset consists of:

- 📚 **Water\_Analysis\_Data.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing and model training.
- 📝 **Water\_Analysis.sql**: SQL queries for data extraction and transformation.
- 🎨 **water\_Potability\_Analysis\_Dashboard.pbix**: Power BI dashboard visualizing key insights from the dataset.
- 🏷️ **logo-png.png**: Project logo.
- 🖼 **Water-analysis-image.jpg**: Reference image for water quality analysis.

### **Features**

- 🛠️ **Numerical Features**: pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity
- 🌍 **Target Variable**: Potability (Binary: 1 for Potable, 0 for Not Potable)

## **Implementation Details**

### **Steps Involved**

- 💽 **Load the dataset**: Data is loaded using Pandas for analysis.
- 🔄 **Preprocessing**:
  - Handle missing values and outliers.
  - Scale numerical features using StandardScaler.
  - Encode the target variable (Potability: 1 = Potable, 0 = Not Potable).
- 🎮 **Model Training**:
  - Train machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
  - Evaluate model performance using cross-validation.
- 📝 **Predictions**:
  - Predict water potability for test data.
  - Save predictions to `predictions.csv`.
